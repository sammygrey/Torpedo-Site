        <h3>Anonimity for All:</h3>
        <p>
          With internet tracking, surveillance, and throttling, The Tor Project
          helps provide online anonimity for everyone. At Torpedo we are
          building upon that mission to provide variants and extensions of
          technology from The Tor Project. Our technologies are designed to
          create ease of access for people interested in using software provided
          by The Tor Project. We take no credit for the services we provide and
          hope only to increase the audience using and building upon the Tor
          network.

        <h3>By the people, for the People, of the People:</h3>
        <p>
          The Tor Network relies on individual computers acting as nodes for the
          network. Think of this as allowing other users to use your computer's
          address as a VPN or proxy. Currently, The Tor Project provides easy
          installation steps for Linux users wishing to setup a Tor node, but
          with the majority of personal computers using Windows, there is a huge
          audience being overlooked. We provide software such that users can
          utilize technology and contribute to The Tor Project regardless of
          tech experience, so that as many people as possible can help provide
          better anonimity online.

        <h3>Easy Installation:</h3>
        <p>
          The Torpedo Windows installer is designed to be as simple as possible
          so even the most computer illiterate people can install the Tor
          protocol and become a node for the Tor network. It is imperitave to
          our mission that as many people as possible can use and join the Tor
          Network, and in order to achieve that we must provide technology that
          is as easy to use as any major companies projects be that Google,
          Apple, Facebook, or any other company.

            <h3>Free and Open Source:</h3>
            <p>
            In correspondence with The Tor Project, Torpedo is completly free and
            open source. This means you can view, edit, and build upon any assets
            in our existing codebase and request to merge any changes you make.
            While our services are free, if you wish to donate we urge you to
            donate directly to The Tor Project as we feel it is unfair to ask for
            any money for applications built ontop of Tor's amazing codebase. You
            can donate to The Tor Project here or through the donation button at
            the top of the page.
